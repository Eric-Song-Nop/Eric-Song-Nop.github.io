- Kotlin contract is a stable Kotlin feature that is used widely in Kotlin `stdlib`. Contract programming is nothing new, it has been applied to [C# CodeContracts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/debug-trace-profile/code-contracts), [D](https://dlang.org/spec/contracts.html) and even Java? In some of them, contracts works just as an annotation, while in Kotlin, the compiler and the type checker utilize contracts for smart casting and other static checking.
- Let's start with `import kotlin.contracts.*` to use contracts, don't be afraid of naming violation unless you are write smart contract with kotlin:)
